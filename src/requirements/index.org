* Introduction
  This document captures the requirements for the realization of this project.

* Part I
1. experiment specification
2. lab specification which is a agrregate of experiments
3. all directory names and file names are in lower case with no spaces(use
   hyphens)
4. The experiment and lab specifications are pushed to [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-specifications][lab-specifications]]
   repository
5. The specifications checked into [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-specifications][lab-specifications]] repository will adhere to
   the [[https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-platform/blob/refactoring/src/index.org#experiment-specification][experiment]] and [[https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-platform/blob/refactoring/src/index.org#lab-specification][lab]] formats.
6. The specifications are done for all the labs and experiments that are part
   of these labs that are listed in the excel sheet.  You pick a strategy to
   write the specification: either read from the [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-specifications][lab-specifications]] repository
   or read from the [[http://vlab.co.in][web]] or [[https://github.com/virtual-Labs][github]] or [[data.vlabs.ac.in/labs][data service]]

* Part II

1. LDS reads json files and populates the database.
2. These specifications are pushed to LDS repository.
   - Clone the repo
   - create a branch called =specifications= from the =develop= branch
   - check out to this branch
   - create a directory =specifications=
   - push the new specifications done according to the [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service/blob/data-model/src/design/index.org#specification][spec]] to this branch.
